= JWT Module Connector Reference


This is the main class of an extension, is the entry point from which configurations, connection providers, operations and sources are going to be declared.



== Configurations
---
[[Config]]
=== jwt-config


Default configuration


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Signature Algorithm a| Enumeration, one of:

** RS256
** RS512 |  The encryption algorithm to be used when signing the token |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Private Key File Path a| String |  Location of the private key file |  | {nbsp}
| Public Key File Path a| String |  Location of the public key file |  | {nbsp}
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit. |  | {nbsp}
|===


==== Associated Operations
* <<Sign>> {nbsp}



== Operations

[[Sign]]
== Sign
`<jwt:sign>`


Example of an operation that uses the configuration and a connection instance to perform some action.


=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Payload a| Object |  |  #[payload] | {nbsp}
| Output Mime Type a| String |  The mime type of the payload that this operation outputs. |  | {nbsp}
| Config Ref a| ConfigurationProvider |  The name of the configuration to be used to execute this component |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Target Variable a| String |  The name of a variable on which the operation's output will be placed |  | {nbsp}
| Target Value a| String |  An expression that will be evaluated against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression will be stored in the target variable |  #[payload] | {nbsp}
| Error Mappings a| Array of <<ErrorMapping>> |  Set of error mappings |  | {nbsp}
